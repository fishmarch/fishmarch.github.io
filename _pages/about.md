# Welcome!
I am Xiaoyu Zhang (Âº†Âï∏ÂÆá), a third year PhD student from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), under the supervision of Prof.[Yun-hui Liu](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liu-yun-hui/). I got my master and bachelor degree from Beihang University (BUAA), advised by Prof.[Wei Wang](http://www.me.buaa.edu.cn/info/1072/1897.htm). I am also fortunate to work with Dr.[Ji Zhao](https://sites.google.com/site/drjizhao/) and Prof.[Shiyu Zhao](https://www.shiyuzhao.net/).

My research interests include computer vision in self-driving, SLAM and robotics.
